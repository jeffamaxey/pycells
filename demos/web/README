Cells CMS: A wiki-type web thing demonstrating the use of cells in web
applications.

It's pretty simple. Modify cms.cfg to suit your environment -- the
defaults should work fine unless you have server running on port 8088
-- then run cms.py. It will begin serving static documents out of the
configured static directory (./static, by default). Navigating to
non-static files will either load out of the on-disk store (in
./store) or offer to create the file. All files are cached in memory
(which could present a problem if you were to use this for anything serious).

Editing documents -- which are cells -- causes the changes to cascade
throughout the cached documents. For instance, if you modify the
special element __header__, which is used in the default template, it
will cascade that change automatically to all cached pages which use
the template.
