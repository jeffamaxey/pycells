These tutorials are meant to to step you through some of the basics of
    using cells. I'd strongly suggest looking at basic.py first, but
    the rest can be done in whatever order interests you the most.
    	
    	basic.py: Cells 101. Input cells and Rule cells are covered,
    	    along with using the Model class
    
	observers.py: In general, one wants to keep rules free of side
    	    effects. Observers allow you to hold to this and get some
    	    actual work done.
    
	cell_varieties.py: There's more to choose from in the cell
    	    menagerie than just input and rules. This tutorial
    	    introduces you to some of what's there.
    
	family.py: Some applications require an large number of
    	    similar Models. The Family class can ease some pains with
    	    these apps.
